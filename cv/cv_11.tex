% \noindent \textit{}\\\\

I am a final year master student in Shanghaitech University.
I'm interested in electronic design automation and exploring new architectures for various kinds of applications.
My current research focuses on In-memory-computing, ReRAM based neural network accelerator and its reliability.
I am also broadly interested in DNN model compression, AI-assisted EDA, AI-assisted design for architecture, domain specific architecture.

{Using Xilinx HLS and FPGA to accelerate CNN}
{Execution time hotspots of the CNN code is identified.
    And then the code accelerate is by setting loop unrolling, pipeline, online buffer and high speed bus etc., using HLS syntax, 
    to achieve the maximum resource utilization, data efficiency and clock frequency.\\
    Project results: Compared with the code that directly running on the ARM kernel, 
    execution time of the optimized convolution layer is reduced to 30 times.

    including transistor level circuit, basic cells and layout design, functional simulation, pre-/post-layout simulation.
    The power and delay is optimized in algorithm level and circuit level.

    Image enhancement algorithm acceleration using General-Purpose Re-configurable Processor
}
{
    % General-Purpose Re-configurable Processor is an architecture with multi-core and re-configurable router.
    % General-Purpose Re-configurable Processor is a typical architecture that organizes with processing element array and re-configurable routers.
    The architecture of General-Purpose Re-configurable Processor consists of processing element array and re-configurable routers, which is similar to GPU.
    By manually scheduling resources and tasks, I tried to improve the execution time of the image enhancement algorithms, such as wight balance and gray world,
    with proper data re-using, pipeline scheduling, loop unrolling,  trace scheduling and Multi-threading.
